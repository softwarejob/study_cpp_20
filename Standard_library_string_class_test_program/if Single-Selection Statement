pseudocode
if student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
    print "Passed" （第二行縮排為optional，為清晰起見，建議使用）

C++

if (studentGrade >= 60) {
    cout << "Passed";
}

C++與pseudocode密切相關

bool Data Type
zero is treated as false
nonzero is treated as true

compiler can implicitly convert true to 1 and false to 0
