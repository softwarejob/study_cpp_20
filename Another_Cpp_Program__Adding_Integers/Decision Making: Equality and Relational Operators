Relational operators
        >                       >             x>y           x is greater than y
        <                       <             x<y           x is less than y
        ≥                       >=           x >= y         x is greater than or equal to y
        ≤                       <=           x <= y         x is less than or equal to y
Equality operators
        =                       ==           x == y         x is equal to y
        ≠                       !=           x != y         x is not equal to y

關係運算子從左到右都具有相同的優先順序和組。
相等運算子具有相同的優先順序

== 和 =
相等運算子==與賦值運算子=混淆會導致邏輯錯誤。
相等運算子==讀為"等於"或"雙相等"
賦值運算子=讀為"得到"或"得到值"或"被分配值"
